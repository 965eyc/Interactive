		<h1><b> Antique </b></h1>
		<p>
		At fine art stores, sellers do most of the sort work themselves, as 
		they have only chosen the most valuable objects to offer for sale.
		</p>
		<p>
		But in most circumstances, the burden of sorting through the material 
		culture of the past is on the buyer, who sifts through objects to 
		find what is useful, visually pleasing, or priced at a bargain.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 <br>
		 <b><i> Collectors sort with the purpose 
		 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		 and hope to find the exceptional objects
		 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		 in the common horde. </i></b></p>
