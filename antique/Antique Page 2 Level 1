	At fine art stores, sellers do most of the sorting work themselves, 
	as they have only chosen the most valuable objects to offer for sale.
	</p>
	<p>
	But in most circumstances, the burden of sorting through the material 
	culture of the past is on the buyer, who sifts through the objects 
	to find what is useful, visually, pleasing, or priced at a bargain.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	By means of its style and the durability of
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	its materiality, antiques, have the capacity to
	&nbsp; &nbsp;
	evoke and preserve for us the image
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	find exceptional object in the common horde.
